### Requirements

 > Use Moodle to submit a single zip or compressed tar file with your source code. Do NOT submit any
 > class files or other binary files (e.g., jar files)! That is, before creating the submission file, make sure
 > you execute an ‘mvn clean’ in your project’s directory (and that Eclipse or other IDE is closed so as to
 > avoid having the class files rebuilt in the background). Also include in the above file a README.txt
 > file outlining (a) your solution (a discussion of the DAG of transformations that you ended up with,
 > on top of the “standard” PageRank DAG), (b) any interesting aspects of your solution, as well as (c)
 > any modifications you may have done to the provided project/maven build files (or instructions to
 > build/package/execute your code, if you haven’t used Java for your implementation).
