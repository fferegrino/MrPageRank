# PageRank calculation - Big Data  

This repository hosts the code for both assessed exercises corresponding to the Big Data course at the University of Glasgow.  

(you can watch a video I made about the course here: [https://youtu.be/bQ-2mZoWLGE](https://youtu.be/bQ-2mZoWLGE))

   
## General task
The task was to implement a watered-down version of the PageRank algorithm over a parsed version of the complete Wikipedia [edit history as of January 2008](http://snap.stanford.edu/data/wiki-meta.html).   

To achieve such task we were required to design and implement algorithms for parsing, filtering, projecting, and transforming data. 
 
## Excercise 1 (MapReduce)

### Solution    
The solution and its explanation can be found in the folder [wiki](wiki). 
 
## Exercise 2 (Spark)  

The task for this exercise was the same as the previous one, but this time the program needed to offer the option of computing PageRank scores at a user-defined point in time.

### Solution    
The solution and its explanation can be found in the folder [wiki-spark/scala](wiki-spark/scala).
